                                Serialized %field% value MD5 hash as rev index file name.

                                There can be collisions, that's why an rev index file
                                will have multiple primary keys as value, if the is multi than each
                                index row is retrieved and raw values are compared binary until the first
                                full match occurs.

                                Note: if we have an MANY as relation key than some rows are returned
                                after binary comparison of values.

                                Sub folders are sha1 from first 16 bytes of MD5 hashed file name.

For more advanced searches would be used binary search tree located in [ bstr ] folder.
Search comparator should be defined for each field.
Search comparators tree nodes are located in %field%_bstrnds subfolder
